    "Question 2-Why *args and **kwargs is used in some functions? Create a function each for *args and **kwargs\n",

    "Ans- In Python, *args and **kwargs are used to pass a variable number of arguments to a function. The *args \n",

    "a function to accept a variable number of keyword arguments.\n",

    "it adds the argument to the total variable. Finally, the function returns the total variable.\n",

    "We then call the sum_numbers function with five positional arguments and store the result in a variable called result.\n",

    "Ans- An iterator is an 'object' in Python that allows us to iterate over a collection of elements, such as a \n",
